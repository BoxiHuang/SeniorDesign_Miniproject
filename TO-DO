BORIS: write a script that receives 2 arrays with ints, and another array with dates. Graph this data with a humidity over time and temperature over time graph. Can use mock inputs for now

JON: integrate database and login page with error checking if user is not found or password doesn't match. create page for registering as a new user and entering into database.
